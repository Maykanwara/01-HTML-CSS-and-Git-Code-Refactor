# Code Refactor 

## Description

The purpose of this assignment is to improve existing code without changing the functionality, known as refactoring. The main goal of this refactoring is to align the code with accessibility standards so that it is optimized for search engines.

To align the site with accessability standards, I added "alt" information to images on the page. In addition to this change, I organized the semantic structure of the HTML, consolicated the CSS selectors and properties, and added a descriptive comment before each section or grouping in the CSS file.

## Languages
